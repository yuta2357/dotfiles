## Plugin configuration

#### Basic plugin configuration

* Go to Settings -> Packages
* Type "linter-python" and go to plugin settings
* Set path to pylama binary e.g. /usr/bin/pylama
* Select needed pylama options

#### Options added in 2.1.3 version

![Package usage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pchomik/linter-python-doc/master/img/2.1.3.gif)

* Option when lint process is triggered
* Option to choose underline type and underline size
* Pylama "force" option

Please be informed that plugin has to create temporary files to lint file in the fly. In case of any performance issues please try
to change trigger option to "Lint only after save". For such option temporary files are not needed.

## Pylama results depend on plugin order

It was discovered that pylama plugin order may change lint results. Issue is under investigated and will be reported
to pylama project as soon as I get time to create test scenarios.

Tests show that the most trusted configuration is: mccabe,pyflakes,pylint,pep8,pep257

#### Pyflakes plugin may change pylama result

New issue was created in pylama project. Pylama results are not constant when pyflakes plugin is enabled.

Issue details are available [here](https://github.com/klen/pylama/issues/67).
